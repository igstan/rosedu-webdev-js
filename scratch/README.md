All you have is this empty directory. Create an HTML page with a button which
when clicked toggles the background color of the body between red and green.
The JS must be located in its own file. Use a CSS class to change the color of
the body. The CSS must be located in its own file.

Here's how to work with CSS classes using the DOM API:

```js
element.classList.contains("some-css-class");
element.classList.add("some-css-class");
element.classList.remove("some-css-class");
```

For bonus points, study the API offered by the `classList` object and see if it
offers any other useful utility methods except the above three.

Examples in: ../events/dom-load.html


1. HTML
2. JS
3. CSS
